# Python for beginners

This is (self-study) material for learning Python programming language. It is
intended for beginners who have no prior experience in programming.

This is matrial is based on the book _Python programming for biology,
bioinformatics and beyond_ by Tim J. Stevens and Wayne Boucher, Cambridge
University Press, 2015.  However, note that the material is by no means
specific to biology or bioinformatics, and can be used by anyone who wants to
learn the Python programming language.

Once you have mastered this material, you are ready to move on to

* [Python for programmers](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-programmers/)
  which is intended for people who have prior experience in programming in
  another language, and want to learn Python.  It goes into considerable
  more depth than this material, and covers more advanced topics.
* [Scientific Python](https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-Python/)
  which is intended for people who have prior experience in programming in
  Python, and want to learn how to use Python for scientific computing.
* [Python for data science](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-data-science/)
  which is intended for people who have prior experience in programming in
  Python, and want to learn how to use Python for data science.


## What is it?

   the concepts of modeling and programming, and how they relate to each other.
1. `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks that explain the concepts of the Python
   programming language.
1. `exercises`: exercises to practice the concepts, mostly as Jupyter
   notebooks.
1. `extra-exercises`: additional exercises to practice the concepts, mostly as
   Jupyter notebooks.
1. `environment.yml`: a conda environment file to create an environment
   with the necessary packages to run the notebooks.
1. `docs`: directory that contains the website for this training.
1. `CONTRIBUTING.md`: guidelines for contributing to the repository.
