This is matrial is based on the book _Python programming for biology,
bioinformatics and beyond_ by Tim J. Stevens and Wayne Boucher, Cambridge
University Press, 2015.  However, note that the material is by no means
specific to biology or bioinformatics, and can be used by anyone who wants to
learn the Python programming language.


## What is it?

1. `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks that explain the concepts of the Python
   programming language.
1. `exercises`: exercises to practice the concepts, mostly as Jupyter
   notebooks.
1. `extra-exercises`: additional exercises to practice the concepts, mostly as
