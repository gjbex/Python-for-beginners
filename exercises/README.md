# Exercises
A number of exercises concentrating on algorithms and data structures.

## What is it?
1. `bin_search.ipynb`: searching a sorted list, first using linear search,
    then implementing a binary search algorithm.
1. `convolution.ipynb`: implement the convolution of an image with a
    filter, mostly `numpy` matrix operations, and keeping track of
    indices.
1. ``de_bruijn_graph.ipynb`: compute a De Bruijn graph from fragments of
    a string, and use an Eulerian path finding algorithm to reconstruct
    the original string. For simplicity, no repetitions are considered.
1. `fits.ipynb`: compare linear and nonlinear fits for an expeonential
    decay function, exercise on `scipy`/`matplotlib`.  The file
    `decay_counts.txt` contains the data for this exercise.
1. `n_queens.ipynb`: placing n queens on a n x n board such that none can
    take the other.  Illustration of a backtracking algorithm.
1. `quicksort.ipynb`: illustration of a divide and conquer algorithm.
1. `smith_waterman`: compute a local alignment using the Smith-Waterman
    algorithm.  Illustration of a dynamic programming algorithm.
1. `unique_distribution.ipynb`: when creating a sequence out of a given
    alphabet, how may unieuq elements can be expected given the the
    length of the sequence?

## Python for biologists
['Python for biologists', Martin Jones, 2015](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) has exercises that are useful.  Input can be found in the
`PythonForBiologists` directory, organized per chapter.

1. `py4bio_2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 2.
    The notebook can be used as a slideshow.
1. `r4bio_2_*.R`: R implementations of the exercises of chapter 2.
1. `py4bio_3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 3.
    The notebook can be used as a slideshow.
1. `py4bio_4.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 4.
    The notebook can be used as a slideshow.
1. `py4bio_5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 5.
    The notebook can be used as a slideshow.
1. `py4bio_6.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 6.
    The notebook can be used as a slideshow.
1. `py4bio_7.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the exercises of chapter 7.
    Work in progress.
1. `UseModules`: small illustration of using functions in modules.
